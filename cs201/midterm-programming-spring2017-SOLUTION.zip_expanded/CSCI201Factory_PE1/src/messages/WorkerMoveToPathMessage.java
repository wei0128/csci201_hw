 * WorkerMoveToPathMessage:
	â€¢	Like all Messages, its only method is its constructor, which takes in data as its parameters (in this case, a FactoryWorker and a Stack holding its path). All the constructor does is set the corresponding data members, so that when the message is serialized the receiver can access it.
