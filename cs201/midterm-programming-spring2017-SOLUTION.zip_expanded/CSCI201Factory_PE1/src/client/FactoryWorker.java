/*
 * FactoryWorker.java:
	•	createWorkers() only does three things, one of which is create a new FactoryWorker.
	•	The important thing here is the run() method. You will learn about threads, but basically each FactoryWorker is its own thread, which means they can all execute their run() methods at what appears to be the same time.
	•	Note: you will not be responsible for threading, however you should be able to manipulate the code inside thread-related code. For example, you have edited code inside of locks (myLock.lock() -> some code -> myLock.unlock(). Therefore you should be able to manipulate code inside of run() and similar methods, excluding atLocation.await(), Thread.sleep(1), etc.
 
 	run():
	•	Notice the try block is a big while loop. It may seem that the loop will execute very frequently, but there are conditions inside the loop that the worker will wait on (again, outside of your scope right now).
	•	Assigning the worker a task:
		o	The if statement ensures you only assign the worker a task if they don’t have a product to make.
		o	mDestinationNode…: assigns the task board as the destination node
		o	mShortestPath…: calls FactoryNode’s findShortestPath() method to find the shortest path to the task board
		o	mFactory.sendWorkerMoveToPath(): calls Factory’s sendWorkerMoveToPath() method to send a message to the front-end client that the worker has been assigned a path (see sendWorkerMoveToPath() below).
		o	atLocation.await(): the worker waits for a signal from the front-end client that it has finished animating/moving the worker to its destination. This happens in JavaScript, remember the MVC design pattern.
		o	while (!mDestinationNode.aquireNode()) { Thread.sleep(1); }: the worker waits in line for the task board to be free if there are other workers at the task board.
		o	mProductToMake…: since we have exited the above while loop, we know we are at the task board. The task board assigns the worker a task.
		o	Thread.sleep(1000): the task board takes one second to assign a task to a worker.
		o	mDestinationNode.releaseNode(): the task board is now free so the next worker can use it (outside of your scope).

	•	Building the product:
		o	A product is composed of multiple resources. Just like assigning a task, a path to each resource in the product is sent to the client (mDestinationNode() -> mShortestPath() -> mFactory. sendWorkerMoveToPath()).
		o	atLocation.await() ensures that the code will not continue until the worker receives a signal that it is at the desired resource.
		o	FactoryResource toTake…: gets resource at the destination node (which we know is a resource node)
		o	toTake.takeResource(): calls FactoryResource’s takeResource() method to decrement the number of that resource still available.
		o	mFactory.sendResources(): calls Factory’s sendResources() method (see sendWorkerMoveToPath()).
	•	Updating the task board table:
		o	mDestinationNode… -> mShortestPath -> mFactory. sendWorkerMoveToPath()  -> atLocation.await() tells the front-end to send the worker to the table and waits for a signal that this has happened.
		o	mFactory.getTaskBoard().endTask(mProductToMake): calls the FactoryTaskBoard’s endTask() method which updates
		o	mFactory.getTaskBoard().endTask(): worker no longer has a product to make, so we set it to null to prepare for the next loop of the while loop.
 
 	sendWorkerMoveToPath():
	•	All the send___() methods in the factory code all do the same thing, which is send a message to the client.
	•	send(new WorkerMoveToPathMessage(worker, pathStack)): calls Factory’s send() method, which just takes a Message.
